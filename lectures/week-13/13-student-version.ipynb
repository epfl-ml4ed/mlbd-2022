    "This notebook provides an introduction to explaining the predictions of your neural network model. Building upon last week's fairness lecture, this lecture on explainability is especially relevant to the ethical concerns of modeling human data. Explainable AI aims to answer the question: why did my black box model make prediction y for features x?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we look at two different classes of AI explainability: global surrogate models (estimating the whole black box) and local surrogate models (explaining one instance's prediction). In this notebook, we will investigate using **LIME** to explain neural network models.\n",
