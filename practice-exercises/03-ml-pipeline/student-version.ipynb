    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For telecommunication companies, it is key to attract new customers and at the same time avoid contract terminations (i.e., churn) to grow their revenue generating base. Looking at churn, different reasons trigger customers to terminate their contracts, such as better price offers, more interesting packages, bad service experiences or change of customers’ personal situations. Churn analytics provides valuable capabilities to predict customer churn and also define the underlying reasons that drive it. With this in mind, telecommunication companies might decide to apply machine learning models to predict churn on an individual customer basis and take counter measures, such as discounts, special offers or other gratifications to keep their customers. Therefore, in this homework, we will imagine that a company asks you to predict whether its customers are about to churn by means of a machine-learning approach. \n",

    "Specifically,  we will ask you to:\n",

    "Implement and evaluate a machine-learning approach appropriately, based on the task and data set (e.g., size). \n",

    "A range of machine-learning algorithms available in the field have been explored in the lectures and the lab sessions, and choosing the one you think that is most likely to perform best depends on your problem type and data. As you have seen in this course, certain algorithms are better suitable for regression tasks, while others for classification tasks, as an example. The data also plays a key role in the process of choosing the right algorithm for the right problem. Some algorithms can work with smaller sample sets, while others require lots of samples. Similarly, certain algorithms can work better with categorical data, while others work better with numerical input. Once you select the algorithm you will use for the next steps:\n",
    "- you **could** pre-process here the features in `X` (**if necessary/appropriate**), in such a way that they are ready to be fed into the selected algorithm; \n",

    "*REMARK: please, note that pre-processing your data is NOT mandatory in the sense that you should pre-process the features in X only if necessary or appropriate, based on the model you chose and how it is able to deal with the data at hand. It is just important that you justify your decisions. Just in case you might need to encode categorical variables, as mentioned in lab session 3, scikit-learn has nice classes for this purpose, namely [LabelEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html) or [OneHotEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html). Another nice alternative is to use the [pd.get_dummies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html) function of Pandas. We copy here again the reading mentioned in lab session 3 on these three encoding strategies: [this supporting tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/categorical-encoding-using-label-encoding-and-one-hot-encoder-911ef77fb5bd).*"
