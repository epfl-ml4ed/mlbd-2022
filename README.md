# Machine Learning for Behavioral Data @ EPFL (CS-421)

## Introduction
Computer environments such as educational games, interactive simulations, and web services provide large amounts of data, which can be analyzed and serve as a basis for adaptation. This course will cover the core methods of user modeling and personalization, with a focus on educational data.

## Structure
This repository contains the slides, in-class demonstrations, and interactive notebooks for each lecture in the `lectures` folder, organized by week. In `project`, you will find the starter code and outline notebooks for relevant milestones of the project. The `practice-exercises` folder contains additional material for practice, created from homework assignments of past iterations of the course. The folder `tutorials` contains demos shown in the tutorial sections of the course.

## Contributing
This code is provided for educational purposes and aims to facilitate reproduction of lab sessions.
We have done our best to document, refactor, and test the code before publication.
